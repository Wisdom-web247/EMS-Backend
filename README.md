## Overview

This is a simple Employee Management System API built with Java Spring Boot and Maven. It provides a set of RESTful endpoints for managing employee data, such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving employee records.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on employee records.
- **Validation**: Input data validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Security**: Basic authentication for protecting API endpoints.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Interactive API documentation using Swagger UI.
- **Logging**: Log important events and errors for debugging and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java 11 or higher installed on your system.
- Apache Maven 3.8.1 or higher.
- Your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with Spring Boot support (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Git to clone the repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd employee-management-api
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The API should now be running locally at `http://localhost:8080`. You can access the Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` for detailed information on available endpoints and how to use them.

## Configuration

You can configure the application by modifying the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory. Here, you can set database configurations, security settings, and more.

## Usage

This API provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/employees`: Create a new employee record.
- `GET /api/employees/{id}`: Retrieve an employee by ID.
- `GET /api/employees`: Retrieve a list of all employees.
- `PUT /api/employees/{id}`: Update an existing employee record.
- `DELETE /api/employees/{id}`: Delete an employee by ID.

Refer to the Swagger documentation for detailed information on request and response formats.

## Security

By default, basic authentication is enabled for the API endpoints. You can customize security settings in the `SecurityConfig.java` file.
